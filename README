 ANT: ant clean debug
 gradle: gradle clean build
 
mGerrit's AOKP Embeded version:
   This software comes included in the AOKP firmware stack. The apk is included
as a signed prebuilt apk.  This allows updating from the PlayStore, avoids
provider authority collisions and removes mGerrit from AOKP version dependancy.

To find the prebuilt apk please see $TOP/vendor/aokp/prebuilt/common/mGerrit.apk
