mGerrit TODO List

Outstanding
===========
- Reset project if current project not listed in current Gerrit
- New Projects view using ExpandableListView
- Non-blocking JSON fetching operations
	- Could include fetching JSON details in navigation bar (with ability to cancel using expandable notifications)
- Smarter refresh - ideal: deprecate manual refresh and refresh automatically
	- Compare change updated timestamps and change ids to determine when the rest of the data is old and does not need to be changed
	- Only load the new stuff and don't reset all the cards views if not necesscary.
- Do not default to one specific gerrit - open up the list of Gerrits to choose from. This applies only when there is no app data (e.g. mgerrit has just been installed)
- Give a visual aid to which Gerrit source is currently selected in Gerrit selection dialog
- Master-detail view
	- Convert PatchSetViewerActivity into a Fragment
- When selecting a committer, use the currently selected tab to determine which changes of theirs to view
- More feedback on which Gerrit is selected
	- Change gerrit selector icon to match the current Gerrit
		- If custom Gerrit either:
			a) Use generic icon (even the application icon will do)
			b) Let user upload a custom identifying icon
- Only show 'AOKP Changelog' option when the AOKP Gerrit is selected
- Migrate Help dialog information into long-press hints. Could show hint when long pressing on a tab or on the card stripe. This needs more thought...
- If downloading dialog is to be left, don't include details about the type of data
- Combine 'org.apache.commons.codec' into library (jar) and import it. Probably don't need to be working on the source for this.
- Add hook (intent filter?) that allows mgerrit to open from a Gerrit url
    - Change preferences (either temporarily or permently) to the gerrit from the URL
    - When given a change link open that specific change
    - When given a Gerrit link just change the current Gerrit
- When there are no comments on a change, don't display comments card
- Ability to track projects across different Gerrits
    - Example, I could be following CM's Gerrit and view mGerrit changes on AOKP's Gerrit
    - May want to put this in a new slide-out menu
        - List all tracked projects under the the one heading (that is collapsable)
- Seperate debug/release versioning (not sure if gradle fully supports this)
- Layout optimisations using Android Hierarchy Viewer (debug version)
- Lint optimisations:
    - Use --html switch: Very pretty output.

Database
--------
	- Change List table
	- Change set (details) table
	- Fetch all data from database and when new data, insert into database and query it
		- Ensures the database is up to date with the data being displayed
		- Would need to manage multiple loaders and adapters if binding JSON data directly as well as database cursors
    - Change GerritTask so query operations can be performed by a loader with feedback provided directly through to the Activity by using a publish-subscribe model
    - Hide database query strings and internals in the respective database table class 

Searching (Requires database), action bar
-----------------------------
	- Project list searching: Type in the name of a project and it shows the matching subprojects under their corresponding root. i.e filters out unmatching subprojects.
	- General searching:
		- mimic Gerrit web interface queries
		- Support searching for a specific commit heading (default). e.g. searching for "commit:[translation]" will show a heading for Commits and list all the commits with "[translation]" in the title.
		- Where it is ambigious (e.g. search results from commits and committers) show results under section headings. These section headings should be collapsable.

CardsUI Library
----------------
	- Remove top gradient
	- Decrease padding between cards
	- Investigate card swiping
	- Include card stripe colouring support/update library to Androguide

CM Gerrit (Requires Server side changes)
----------------------------------------
	- Get change diffs

Future Direction
----------------
- Authentication/Authorisation
	- Not sure if Gerrit API(s) supports this
	- Show system prompt such as "mgerrit is requesting access to...", such as when an Oauth2 token is requested (something similar to what happens when you use the Google Play Services APIs anyway).
	- This will make way for mGerrit to become a full-blown Gerrit client/portal.

More on Auth (privileged actions)
---------------------------------
    - Would be OK if we only supported G+ (Google) signin initially
    - Ideal: User gets email opens in mGerrit, can login (if not already) - can we use the gmail address here? View messages for change (& diff) and post a change review (along with verification if allowed)
        - Will probably need to wait for gerrit updates (to server(s)) for this though
    - Ability to post inline code comments
        - Prompts about leaving draft comments - not clear that the comments are published with the next review.
    - Sign-up is probably not best handled by a mobile application - requires SSH keys to be generated to fully sign up.
    - Gerrit account preference modifications
        - Track projects (sign up to emails)
            - Could even track these in mGerrit with updates view/tab

Optional/Lower priority
-----------------------
	- Add support for API 7+
		- Switch to ActionBarComapt/ActionbarScherlock
	- Colour cards stripe instead of including 'new'/'merged'/'abandoned'. Suggest: open/review => black or transparent, merged => green, abandoned => red
	- Colour each project in a sperate colour
	- Add tab for reviewed (verified)
	    - May be useful for admins or others wishing to cherry pick changes that compile
	    - Either revied in past PS or reviewed in current patch set - up to server classification
	- Shortcut for when mGerrit is in-built (not useful for market version)
	    - This could be part of a custom build varient especially for AOKP
